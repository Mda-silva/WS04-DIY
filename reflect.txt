During this workshop, I gained a wealth of knowledge on various concepts and topics. Initially, I delved into constructors and destructors, understanding their functionalities and the flexibility they offer in parameterization, even allowing for use without parameters. Additionally, I grasped the ability to define constant values within them. Exploring further, I learned about class and object structures, discovering techniques for manipulation, such as embedding class arrays within other classes, which streamlines code execution. Although I encountered few obstacles throughout the workshop, one notable challenge involved memory deallocation in the reString function. However, I swiftly resolved this issue by implementing the appropriate deallocation conditions. This workshop further aided in my knowledge in object oriented programming.
